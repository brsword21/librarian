"""Round-4 merge helper: combine gated post-fix wrappers that all sit on the same frozen base lens.

first_changed(q, hx, base, candidates): build the base pack, then each candidate in priority order; the first
candidate whose Reactor-visible content (passage ids + texts, hint) differs from the base wins. If none differs,
the base pack is returned. A candidate that raises is skipped (logged in debug["merge_errors"]).
Each spec is (lens_path, variant, extra_params). Used by lenses/<type>/merged_r4.py.
