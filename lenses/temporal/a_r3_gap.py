"""Temporal lens A, round 3 ("Struktura"): the frozen v1 temporal route (merged_r2 evA_mixB = a_gap ct_evgba on gap /
named-event questions + b_merge ev1_mix_g elsewhere) plus two structural additions that target what the test audit
showed (test temporal = 35 gap questions + 1 "how many years did I serve" question):

  * span    - "how many years did I serve / work / spend as X": the answer is end age - start age (or end year - start
              year) from two first-person statements ("I joined the fire brigade when I was 23", "I retired from the
              fire department the day I turned 63"). v1 sent B's whole-question pack with neither statement. The two
              statements are found by an age / year pattern + start / end verb scan over user sentences, filtered to
              the user's own statements (subject_kind) and ranked by cross-encoder relevance to the question.
  * own     - own-absence check for gap / ago packs without a confident computed value: when an event of the
              question has no first-person user statement that covers its content words (only "Camille bought
              trail-running shoes today", only "I still need to sort out my travel vaccines", no "loaf" at all), the
              pack is cut to the sessions of the closest mentions (budget own_budget), the hint lists those mentions
              as what they are (someone else's / not done yet) instead of "date notes", and abstain_p >= own_ap.
